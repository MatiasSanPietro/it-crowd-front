# React + TypeScript + Vite

Features: List of products, detailed view of products with brand, search by name or description, all CRUD operations, dark mode theme switch.

I used Vite to create the proyect, chakra-ui for styling and vercel to deploy.

Deploy link: https://it-crowd-front.vercel.app/ (I had a problem deploying the backend but I can fix it in these days).

Remote run:

npm install

npm run type

npm run dev (in other terminal)
